**Project title**: New York City Payroll

**Team members**: Nicole Cosmany and Ebrahim Azarisooreh

Description of the project: In this project, we are focusing  on New York City’s payroll data. Our goal is to explore how the city allocates its payroll budget across various job titles and departments. By analyzing this data, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of budget allocation trends, identify patterns over time, and uncover insights into the relative financial priorities of various departments and roles within the city. 

**Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers**:
1. *How is the total NYC payroll budget allocated among departments? Among boroughs?* <br>

The top spending boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. The top spending departments are the Department of Education, Police Department, and Fire Department. 

2. *How does pay for a certain job title vary from year to year? Does the average pay for a certain job title vary noticeably across boroughs?* <br>

An overview of compensation across 10 diverse government allocated jobs in NYC, shows salaries mostly bundled in the 30 - 60 an hour range, with a noticeable departure from that grouping at above $100/hr for the Executive Director position.The Attorney position has a steep drop off to 0 around 2023, but appears to be an anomaly where there was actually no pay to anybody in this position during that fiscal year.The most notable outlier in this selected group of titles is that of “Assistant Professor”, which ranges from 230 to 280 an hour, which is a clear outlier for the entire selected group.
The overall trend throughout the years is trending generally upwards for all positions. Most are inline with expected US inflation rates of ~2.5 - 3.5% per annum. The Certified Applications Developer was notably lower at around 1.6% percent increase, while the School Lunch Helper was showing ~11% increase per year, though was the lowest paying job by far in this group. All pay increase rates were measured using the geometric means to account for compounding rates.


3. *How much of the total payroll spending is for overtime? Are certain departments consistently spending more on overtime? Can we predict overtime spending? Are certain job titles working overtime more often than others?* <br>

The total payroll spending for overtime varies between 6-9% of total payroll spending over the past decade. There is some variation among departmental spending but we have consistently high spenders like the Fire Department, Department of Correction, Department of Sanitation, and Police Department. There were interesting trends surrounding these departments following the 2020 pandemic. Department was a very strong predictor of number of overtime hours worked (much stronger than number of employees within a department). Finally, the job titles most commonly working overtime are Police Officer, Firefighter, Correction Officer, and Sanitation Officer.

4. *How does pay rate/salary relate to employment duration? Do employees who are paid more/less have longer/shorter tenures than others? How does this vary across boroughs, departments, and job title?* <br>

When  examining the compensation rates of each job juxtaposed with employment duration, there doesn’t seem to be an obvious relationship here. For example, the lowest paying job (School Lunch Helper), had the longest tenure, and in second place was Research Scientist which was one of the higher paying jobs, but also had the second longest tenure of the group. Executive Director and Assistant Professor were the top 2 highest paying jobs in this group, but had fairly low tenures. Overall, It looks like this slice of the data (which is well diversified across sectors) doesn’t show any promising trends in terms of a relationship between pay and employment duration.

**Application of this knowledge**: Our results are useful for a wide range of audiences interested in NYC government spending and employee pay - including government planners, hiring managers, job seekers, and curious taxpayers.
